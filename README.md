# 3DWeb
Hello people of the internet, This is the [GitHub](https://github.com) Repository for the website, 3DWeb.

## What is 3DWeb
3DWeb is a website where you can see advanced 3D Graphics in your browser, it's like a Satisfying-Physics-3D Awesomess-Ball all turned into one stunning website.

## Features
Relaxing 3D simulations.
Cool 3D stuff.
Even more cool 3D stuff.
`Oh, don't forget the cool 3D Schtuff.`
But seriously, we have lots of pages, and lots of different simulations that you can interact with and watch, and this website is one of the only websites left that actually gets updated :shock:
So why not, hop on over to [3DWeb](https://pxslgames.github.io/3dweb) and experience it yourself.

## Forking etc
If you are planning on forking this repository, don't, I am happy to intake ideas from the community, but this website is mine, and I don't want people forking it, thanks!

## Goodbye!
So that is it, I hope this explained what 3DWeb is, and everything about it, It's quite a large range of things, so it's hard to explain.
